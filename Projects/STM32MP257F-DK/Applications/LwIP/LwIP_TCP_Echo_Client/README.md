@par Application Description

This application guides STM32Cube HAL API users to run TCP Echo Client application
based on Raw API of LwIP TCP/IP stack

To run this application, On the remote PC, open a command prompt window.
(In Windows, select Start > All Programs > Accessories > Command Prompt.)
At the command prompt, enter:
    C:\>echotool /p tcp /s
where:
    – /p transport layer protocol used for communication (TCP)
    – /s is the actual mode of connection (Server mode)

Each time the user pushes the User Button 2 of the STM32MP257F-DK board, an echo
request is sent to the server

If a DHCP server is available, a dynamic IP address can be allocated by enabling 
the DHCP process (#define LWIP_DHCP to 1 in lwipopts.h)

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

For more details about this application, refer to UM1713 "STM32Cube interfacing with LwIP and applications"

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32MP257FAIx devices.
    
  - This application has been tested with the following environments:
     - STM32MP257F-DK board
     - echotool: (http://bansky.net/echotool/) is used as echo server that sends
       back every incoming data.
     - DHCP server:  PC utility TFTPD32 (http://tftpd32.jounin.net/) is used as a DHCP server

  - STM32MP257F-DK Set-up
    - Connect the DK board to remote PC (through a crossover ethernet cable)
      or to your local network (through a straight ethernet cable)
  
  - Remote PC Set-up
    - PC must share the same LAN network configuration with the DK board
      the IP address must be the same as destination address value in (main.h)


@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
- Open STM32CubeIDE
- Build with config: CA35TDCID_m33_ns_sign
- ssh root@192.168.7.1 'mkdir -p /home/root/LwIP_TCP_Echo_Client/lib/firmware'
- scp LwIP_TCP_Echo_Client_CM33_NonSecure_sign.bin root@192.168.7.1:/home/root/LwIP_TCP_Echo_Client/lib/firmware
- scp fw_cortex_m33.sh root@192.168.7.1:/home/root/LwIP_TCP_Echo_Client/
- To run the example on target: 
	On target shell run:
	- cd /home/root/LwIP_TCP_Echo_Client
	- ./fw_cortex_m33.sh start
