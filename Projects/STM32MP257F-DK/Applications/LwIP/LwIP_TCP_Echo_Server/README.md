@par Application Description 

This application guides STM32Cube HAL API users to run TCP Echo Server application 
based on Raw API of LwIP TCP/IP stack

To run this application, On the remote PC, open a command prompt window.
(In Windows, select Start > All Programs > Accessories > Command Prompt.)
At the command prompt, enter:
  C:\>echotool IP_address /p tcp /r 7 /l 7 /n 15 /t 2 /d Testing LwIP TCP echo server
where:
    – IP_address is the actual board’s IP address. If DHCP is disabled, 
    the following static IP address is used: 192.168.0.10 
    – /p transport layer protocol used for communication (TCP)
    – /r is the actual remote port on the echo server (echo port)
    - /l is the actual local port for the client (echo port)
    – /n is the number of echo requests (for application, 15)
    – /t is the connection timeout in seconds (for application, 2)
    – /d is the message to be sent for echo 

If a DHCP server is available, a dynamic IP address can be allocated by enabling 
the DHCP process (#define LWIP_DHCP to 1 in lwipopts.h)

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32MP257FAIx Devices :
The CPU at 400MHz 

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32MP257FAIx devices.
    
  - This application has been tested with the following environments:
     - STM32MP257F-DK board
     - echotool: (http://bansky.net/echotool/) is used as echo client that sends
       data to the server and checking whether they came back 
     - DHCP server:  PC utility TFTPD32 (http://tftpd32.jounin.net/) is used as a DHCP server    
      
  - STM32MP257F-DK Set-up
    - Connect the DK board to remote PC (through a crossover ethernet cable)
      or to your local network (through a straight ethernet cable)
  
  - Remote PC Set-up
    - PC must share the same LAN network configuration with the DK board


@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
- Open STM32CubeIDE
- Build with config: CA35TDCID_m33_ns_sign
- ssh root@192.168.7.1 'mkdir -p /home/root/LwIP_TCP_Echo_Server/lib/firmware'
- scp LwIP_TCP_Echo_Server_CM33_NonSecure_sign.bin root@192.168.7.1:/home/root/LwIP_TCP_Echo_Server/lib/firmware
- scp fw_cortex_m33.sh root@192.168.7.1:/home/root/LwIP_TCP_Echo_Server/
- To run the example on target: 
	On target shell run:
	- cd /home/root/LwIP_TCP_Echo_Server
	- ./fw_cortex_m33.sh start
