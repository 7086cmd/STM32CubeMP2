# StarterApp_M33TD Demonstration Application

---

## Application Description

The StarterApp_M33TD demonstration is to highlight the capabilities of the STM32MP2 platform for M33TDCID profile, showcasing the M33 as the primary CPU and the A35 as a high-performance coprocessor. This application emphasizes the ability to achieve a fast Cortex-M boot, bypassing the Cortex-A and the associated OpenSTLinux solution, which typically requires several seconds to initialize. By leveraging this approach, the system can quickly execute critical tasks in the non-secure environment while maintaining flexibility for high-performance operations on the A35. This project enables the CM33-NS **Non‑Secure Application Manager** functionality using the common utility stack `Utilities/M33TD_NSAppCore` as the bootstrap/task base (Logger, RemoteProc, SCMI Manager, Watchdog Monitor, OpenAMP, etc.) and keeps board-specific implementations in the project under `CM33/NonSecure/FREERTOS/M33TD_NSAppCore/AppDriver/`.

---

## Key Features

- **FreeRTOS Multitasking**: The application is built on FreeRTOS, enabling multitasking in the non-secure environment.
- **LED Blinking**: Uses the UserApp task to blink an LED every second.
- **A35 Coprocessor Management**: Uses the RemoteProc task to manage the A35 core lifecycle via TF-M secure services.
- **Interrupt Handling**: Configures the EXTI line to receive interrupts on NVIC line 4 of the M33 on the event IWDG RST.
- **Integrate Utility Stack**: Uses `Utilities/M33TD_NSAppCore` for reusable tasks and thin driver abstractions.
- **Optional Display Pipeline**: A build-time option enables a display panel path, with optional dynamic splash animation (see `BUILD_CONFIG` / `BOOT_SPLASHSCREEN`).

---

## Purpose

This is a FreeRTOS-based multitask application running in the NS processing environment, while the TFM secure application operates in the secure processing environment. The secure application acts as a client to process secure services requested by both the A35 and M33 NS.

This application implements the StarterApp functionality (Non‑Secure Application Manager) around the `Utilities/M33TD_NSAppCore` stack. The `NSCoreApp_Init()` bootstrap configures the stack and starts the enabled tasks below:

1. **NSCoreApp (Bootstrap)**:
   - Initializes the common stack and starts the enabled tasks.

2. **Logger Task**:
   - Centralized logging, with optional real-time output.

3. **UserApp Task**:
   - Example application task (LED activity) to validate system liveness.

4. **RemoteProc Task**:
   - Manages the A35 coprocessor lifecycle via TF-M secure services:
     - Optional auto-start at boot (`REMOTE_PROC_AUTO_START`).
     - CPU status retrieval.
     - Crash detection and recovery (stop/start sequence).

5. **SCMI Manager Task**:
   - Handles SCMI notifications and related TF-M forwarding.

6. **Watchdog Monitor Task**:
   - Supervises system health and watchdog-related handling.

7. **OpenAMP Task**:
   - Provides the RPMsg communication layer used by StarterApp to interact with the A35/Linux side.
   - Exposes RPMsg endpoints used by this project:
     - **Power endpoint**: used to send M33-initiated power requests (e.g., reboot/shutdown) to the remote processor.
     - **Display endpoint**: used when the display pipeline is enabled (see **Display Task**) to exchange display messages with Linux.

8. **Button Monitor Task**:
   - Monitors the USER button and can trigger M33-initiated power requests through the OpenAMP power endpoint (e.g., very long press).

9. **Display Task (optional)**:
   - Available when the display pipeline is enabled in the build (see `BUILD_CONFIG=FULL`).
   - When built with `BUILD_CONFIG=MINIMUM`, the display pipeline is disabled, but OpenAMP + Button Monitor remain available for M33-initiated reboot/shutdown use-cases.

### Understanding StarterApp Logs

This log demonstrates the CM33 boot sequence (MCUboot/TF-M), provisioning status, secure→non-secure handover, and the main StarterApp runtime tasks (DisplayTask, Watchdog Monitor, RemoteProc, OpenAMP).

> **Note:** The `[RemoteProc] starting copro cpu@0... (pending)` message followed by `[RemoteProc] copro cpu@0 started.` indicates the A35 coprocessor was started during boot. This behavior is typically enabled by the `REMOTE_PROC_AUTO_START=ON` CMake option, as described in the [Non-Secure M33 Firmware Build (StarterApp_M33TD Application)](#non-secure-m33-firmware-build-starterapp_m33td-application) section.

The log also reflects the specific firmware and configuration used for the device boot:

- **STM32Cube FW version**: `STM32Cube FW version: ...`
- **TF-M version**: `welcome to TF-M: ...`
- **External device tree (DTS)**: `dts: ...-sdcard-s.dts` (compare with the `-DDTS_BOARD_S=...` DTS passed to the TF-M secure build)
- **Key runtime milestones**:
   - Display enabled: `[DisplayTask] Display is initialized and ready...`
   - A35 bring-up: `[RemoteProc] ... started.`
   - RPMsg ready: `[OpenAMP]  Ready for RPMsg communication`
   - Watchdog monitor: `[WdgMonitor] watchdog timeout: ...`

To verify that the correct configuration is reflected, compare the DTS filename(s) and firmware versions shown in the log with the TF-M secure-build CMake options and external DTS files specified during the secure build (see [How to Generate Binaries for Different Boot Modes](#how-to-generate-binaries-for-different-boot-modes)).

StarterApp also implements remote processor crash detection and automatic recovery; see [How to Test and Verify System Behavior](#how-to-test-and-verify-system-behavior).

### How to Test and Verify System Behavior

Once the system has completed boot (e.g., you see `[RemoteProc] copro cpu@0 started.` and, when enabled, `[OpenAMP]  Ready for RPMsg communication`), you can run the checks below. For each test, look for the corresponding activity on the **CM33 UART console**.

1. **Button-triggered A35 reboot (USER2, very long press)**
    - Press **USER2** for **at least 5 seconds**.
    - This uses the Button Monitor task to trigger a reboot request via the OpenAMP “power” RPMsg endpoint (see `Utilities/M33TD_NSAppCore/App/Src/openamp_task.c`).
    - Expected CM33 logs (may vary by build options):
       - `[OpenAMP] request remote processor reboot`
       - A35 restart sequence may be reflected by RemoteProc messages (e.g., crash/recovery and/or stop/start messages).

2. **Simulate a Linux crash and observe recovery**
    - On the Linux console (as `root`), run:
       ```bash
       sync; sleep 2; sync; echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger
       ```
    - This forces a kernel crash on the A35 side. On the CM33 UART, RemoteProc should report crash detection and attempt recovery (for example: `Crash detected ... Attempting recovery...`, then a stop/restart sequence).

3. **Cold reset from Linux**
    - On Linux, run:
       ```bash
       reboot
       ```
    - A cold reset typically reboots the full platform; you should see TF-M/MCUboot banners again on the CM33 UART. Depending on timing, you may also see an SCMI notification such as `SYS_POWER_COLD_RESET` before the reset.

4. **Warm reset from Linux**
    - On Linux, run:
       ```bash
       echo warm >> /sys/kernel/reboot/mode
       reboot
       ```
    - A warm reset typically restarts the A35 while keeping CM33 running; on the CM33 UART you should see `SYS_POWER_WARM_RESET` and a RemoteProc stop/start sequence. When OpenAMP is enabled, you should also see `OpenAMP reinit requested`.

## How to Flash Binaries

1. **Build/Compile the Project**  
  Follow the [Build Procedure](#build-procedure) to generate the required binaries.

2. **Copy and Rename Generated Binaries**  
   Before copying, **rename the generated binaries** (`bl2.stm32`, `ddr_phy_signed.bin`, and `tfm_s_ns_signed.bin`) according to the names specified in the **Required Binaries** section of the relevant flash layout under [Reference Use Cases for MP25-EV1 Board (StarterApp Project)](#reference-use-cases-for-mp25-ev1-board-starterapp-project).  
   Then, navigate to the `bin/` folder and copy the renamed binaries to the following paths:
   ```
   <OSTL-IMAGE-PATH>/images/stm32mp2-m33td/arm-trusted-firmware-m/bl2
   ```
   - Place the renamed `bl2` binary in this directory.
   ```
   <OSTL-IMAGE-PATH>/images/stm32mp2-m33td/m33-firmware
   ```
   - Place the renamed `ddr_phy` and `tfm-starterapp` binaries in this directory.

3. **Modify Flashlayout (TSV)**  
   Select the relevant TSV file under `<OSTL-IMAGE-PATH>/images/stm32mp2-m33td/flashlayout_st-image-weston/optee` as per specific dev mode (see [Flash Layouts for MP25-EV1 Board](#flash-layouts-for-mp25-ev1-board)).
   And then modify the TSV file, by replacing the existing TF-M NS signed binary name with the name of your renamed `tfm-starterapp-..._s_ns_Signed.bin` that corresponds to your chosen boot mode.

4. **Connect the Device**  
  Use a Type-C cable to connect the device to the Type-C connector.

5. **Flash the Image**  
  Refer to the [STM32 MPU wiki](https://wiki.st.com/stm32mpu/) for detailed flashing instructions.

6. **Perform a Power-On Reset**  
  After flashing, perform a power-on reset to complete the process.
