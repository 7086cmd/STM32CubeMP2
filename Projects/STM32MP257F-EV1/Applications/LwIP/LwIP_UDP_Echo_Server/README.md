@par Application Description

This application guides STM32Cube HAL API users to run UDP Echo Server application
based on Raw API of LwIP TCP/IP stack

To run this application, On the remote PC, open a command prompt window.
(In Windows, select Start > All Programs > Accessories > Command Prompt.)
At the command prompt, enter:
  C:\>echotool IP_address /p udp /r 7 /l 7 /n 15 /t 2 /d Testing LwIP UDP echo server
where:
    � IP_address is the actual board�s IP address. By default, the follo
    static IP address is used: 192.168.0.10
    � /p transport layer protocol used for communication (UDP)
    � /r is the actual remote port on the echo server (echo port)
    - /l is the actual local port for the client (echo port)
    � /n is the number of echo requests (for application, 15)
    � /t is the connection timeout in seconds (for application, 2)
    � /d is the message to be sent for ec

If a DHCP server is available, a dynamic IP address can be allocated by enabling
the DHCP process (#define LWIP_DHCP to 1 in lwipopts.h)

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32MP257FAIx devices.

  - This application has been tested with the following environments:
     - STM32MP257F-EV1 board
     - echotool: (http://bansky.net/echotool/) is used as echo client that sends
       data to the server and checking whether they came back
     - DHCP server:  PC utility TFTPD32 (http://tftpd32.jounin.net/) is used as a DHCP server

  - STM32MP257F-EV1 Set-up
    - Connect the eval board to remote PC (through a crossover ethernet cable)
      or to your local network (through a straight ethernet cable)

  - Remote PC Set-up
    - PC must share the same LAN network configuration with the eval board


@par How to use it ?
- For A35 TD
In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
- Open STM32CubeIDE
- Build with config: CA35TDCID_m33_ns_sign
- ssh root@192.168.7.1 'mkdir -p /home/root/LwIP_UDP_Echo_Server/lib/firmware'
- scp LwIP_UDP_Echo_Server_CM33_NonSecure_sign.bin root@192.168.7.1:/home/root/LwIP_UDP_Echo_Server/lib/firmware
- scp fw_cortex_m33.sh root@192.168.7.1:/home/root/LwIP_UDP_Echo_Server/
- To run the example on target:
	On target shell run:
	- cd /home/root/LwIP_UDP_Echo_Server
	- ./fw_cortex_m33.sh start

- For M33 TD
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Open STM32CubeIDE
- Build with config: Release
- LwIP_UDP_Echo_Server.bin file would be generated containing the application.
- refer to the Steps present in Projects\STM32MP215F-DK\Demonstrations\StarterApp_M33TD\README.md to compile remaining binaries.
  LwIP_UDP_Echo_Server.bin need  to be signed. While compiling TFM Secure in StarterAppM33TD add the absolute path to LwIP_UDP_Echo_Server.bin using below argument

  -DSTM32_CA35_FW=`<PATH>`/LwIP_UDP_Echo_Server.bin

- LwIP_UDP_Echo_Server.bin signed binary will be generated in `trusted-firmware-m\config_default\bin folder`.
- This binary Should be programmed along with Binaries generated after continuing steps in Template_StarterApp_M33TD project.
