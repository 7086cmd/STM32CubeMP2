@par Application Description 

This application guides STM32Cube HAL API users to run a http server application 
based on Socket API of LwIP TCP/IP stack
The communication is done with a web browser application in a remote PC.

this HTTP server contains two html pages:
  + the first page (home page) is static, it gives information about LwIP stack.
  + the second page is dynamically refreshed (every 1 s), it shows the RTOS 
    statistics in runtime

If a DHCP server is available, a dynamic IP address can be allocated by enabling 
the DHCP process (#define LWIP_DHCP to 1 in lwipopts.h)

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals and initialize the Flash interface.
The HAL initializes the TIM6 to generate an interrupt each 1ms, it will be used as time base for the HAL drivers.
This application uses FreeRTOS, the RTOS initializes the systick to generate an interrupt each 1ms. 
The systick is then used for FreeRTOS time base.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32MP257FAIx Devices :

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in HAL time base ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the HAL time base interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the HAL time base interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the HAL time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32MP257FAIx devices.
    
  - This application has been tested with the following environments:
     - STM32MP257F-EV1 board
     - Http client: Google Chrome (v55)
     - DHCP server:  PC utility TFTPD32 (http://tftpd32.jounin.net/) is used as a DHCP server    
      
  - STM32MP257F-EV1 Set-up
    - Connect the eval board to remote PC (through a crossover ethernet cable)
      or to your local network (through a straight ethernet cable)
  
  - Remote PC Set-up
    - PC must share the same LAN network configuration with the eval board


@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
- Open STM32CubeIDE
- Build with config: CA35TDCID_m33_ns_sign
- ssh root@192.168.7.1 'mkdir -p /home/root/LwIP_HTTP_Server_Socket_RTOS/lib/firmware'
- scp the signed firmware LwIP_HTTP_Server_Socket_RTOS_CM33_NonSecure_sign.bin to root@192.168.7.1:/home/root/LwIP_HTTP_Server_Socket_RTOS/lib/firmware
- scp the script Firmware/Utilities/scripts/fw_cortex_m33.sh to root@192.168.7.1:/home/root/LwIP_HTTP_Server_Socket_RTOS/
- To run the example on target: 
	On target shell run:
	- cd /home/root/LwIP_HTTP_Server_Socket_RTOS
	- ./fw_cortex_m33.sh start
