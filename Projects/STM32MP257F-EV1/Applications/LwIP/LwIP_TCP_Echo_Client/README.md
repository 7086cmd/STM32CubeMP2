@par Application Description

This application guides STM32Cube HAL API users to run TCP Echo Client application
based on Raw API of LwIP TCP/IP stack

To run this application, On the remote PC, open a command prompt window.
(In Windows, select Start > All Programs > Accessories > Command Prompt.)
At the command prompt, enter:
    C:\>echotool /p tcp /s
where:
    – /p transport layer protocol used for communication (TCP)
    – /s is the actual mode of connection (Server mode)

- For A35-TD
Each time the user pushes the User Button 2 of the STM32MP257F-EV1 board, an echo
request is sent to the server

- For M33-TD
Each time the user pushes the User Button 1 of the STM32MP257F-EV1 board, an echo
request is sent to the server

If a DHCP server is available, a dynamic IP address can be allocated by enabling
the DHCP process (#define LWIP_DHCP to 1 in lwipopts.h)

@par Keywords

Connectivity, LwIP, Ethernet, TCP/IP, DHCP, TCP echo client

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32MP257FAIx devices.

  - This application has been tested with the following environments:
     - STM32MP257F-EV1 board
     - echotool: (http://bansky.net/echotool/) is used as echo server that sends
       back every incoming data.
     - DHCP server:  PC utility TFTPD32 (http://tftpd32.jounin.net/) is used as a DHCP server

  - STM32MP257F-EV1 Set-up
    - Connect the eval board to remote PC (through a crossover ethernet cable)
      or to your local network (through a straight ethernet cable)

  - Remote PC Set-up
    - PC must share the same LAN network configuration with the eval board
      the IP address must be the same as destination address value in (main.h)


@par How to use it ?
- For A35 TD
In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
- Open STM32CubeIDE
- Build with config: CA35TDCID_m33_ns_sign
- ssh root@192.168.7.1 'mkdir -p /home/root/LwIP_TCP_Echo_Client/lib/firmware'
- scp LwIP_TCP_Echo_Client_CM33_NonSecure_sign.bin root@192.168.7.1:/home/root/LwIP_TCP_Echo_Client/lib/firmware
- scp fw_cortex_m33.sh root@192.168.7.1:/home/root/LwIP_TCP_Echo_Client/
- To run the example on target:
	On target shell run:
	- cd /home/root/LwIP_TCP_Echo_Client
	- ./fw_cortex_m33.sh start

- For M33 TD
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Open STM32CubeIDE
- Build with config: Release
- LwIP_TCP_Echo_Client.bin file would be generated containing the application.
- refer to the Steps present in Projects\STM32MP215F-DK\Demonstrations\StarterApp_M33TD\README.md to compile remaining binaries.
  LwIP_TCP_Echo_Client.bin need  to be signed. While compiling TFM Secure in StarterAppM33TD add the absolute path to LwIP_TCP_Echo_Client.bin using below argument

  -DSTM32_CA35_FW=`<PATH>`/LwIP_TCP_Echo_Client.bin

- LwIP_TCP_Echo_Client.bin signed binary will be generated in `trusted-firmware-m\config_default\bin folder`.
- This binary Should be programmed along with Binaries generated after continuing steps in Template_StarterApp_M33TD project.
